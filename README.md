# NginX
Nginx (pronounced "Engine X") is a versatile web server, acting also as a **reverse proxy**, **load balancer**, **mail proxy**, and **HTTP cache**. Here primarily we are going to explore  Nginx as a load balancer. We'll install and configure Nginx on our computer and conduct basic load balancer testing with Django to demonstrate the straightforward process.

Understanding the "**load balancing**" concept is very crucial. It involves distributing incoming network traffic among a group of backend servers using a load balancer to enhance server performance. This method becomes particularly essential during high-traffic periods when numerous users access our site simultaneously. Throughout this guide, we'll cover installing Nginx and setting it up for **Round-Robin** load balancing.
